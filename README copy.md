Practical Programming in Chemistry
==================================

Welcome to the repository for the Practical Programming in Chemistry exercises. Those exercises offers a comprehensive and hands-on introduction to computer programming, tailored specifically for chemists and chemical engineers. With a focus on Python, this course is designed to equip you with the programming skills necessary to tackle real-world chemical tasks.

This course is designed for individuals with little to no programming experience and focuses on applying programming concepts within the context of chemistry and chemical engineering. Through a series of lessons and hands-on exercises.

Our goal is to make programming accessible and relevant to chemists and chemical engineers, enabling you to automate tasks, analyze data, and enhance your research capabilities.
